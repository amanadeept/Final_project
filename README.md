1)	Introduction: What you picked and What is it?

We choose a project Rating Bar ,which is used to get the rating from the app user. A user can simply drag or click on the stars to set the rating value. The value of rating always returns a floating point number which may be 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 etc.

2)	What does it do?

We displayed a rating bar with five custom stars and a submit button. Whenever a user click on the button value of total number of stars and value of rating is shown by using a Toast.
